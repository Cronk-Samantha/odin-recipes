# odin-recipes
This is a multi-page site containing a home page linked to each recipe's page along with pictures, ingredient lists, and directions. 
The purpose of this project was to practice creating a new repo, setting up a multi-page site with embedded links to each page, and formatting 
each page with the correct elements in a way that is easy for user's to read. I practiced my HTML skills by setting up each page with the 
correct HTML format, linking each page in the repo to each other, and using the correct elements to format the body section of my pages. This was
purely just for practice with HTML which is why there is not any formatting on my site.
