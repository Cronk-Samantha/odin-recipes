        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces uncooked penne pasta</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1/2 small onion (finely chopped)</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup vodka (whatver you have on hand)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup tomato paste</li>
            <li>3/4 cup heavy(or whipping) cream</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper to taste</li>
            <li>(Optional) Fresh Basil to top</li>
            <li>Grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil a generously salted pot of water for the 
                penne and cook it al dente according to package
                directions.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, add the oil and butter to a skillet over
                medium heat. Saute the onion for about 5 minutes (or until
                softened).
            </li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Add the vodka and let the sauce bubble for about 30 seconds</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste until ingredients form a smooth mixture.</li>
            <li>Stir in the heavy cream and reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the 
                sauce warm through until thickened. This sauce tends to thicken up within
                a couple minutes so I recommend to keep watch of it and keep heating it 
                until your desired thickness level. 
            </li>
            <li>Season sauce with your desired amount of salt & pepper. If you 
                are using fresh basil, stir that in now. At this point, if your sauce
                is too thick you can splash some of the leftover past water in to thin 
                it out. Add your cooked noodles to the sauce & stir until fully mixed
                together. Serve pasta with the grated parmesean cheese (if desired).
            </li>
        </ol>
