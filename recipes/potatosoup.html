            <li>2 stalks celery (diced)</li>
            <li>1 yellow onion (chopped)</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>8 potatoes (peeled & cubed, for best results use Russet Potatoes)</li>
            <li>4 cups of chicken stock</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons of butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried tarragon</li>
            <li>3 teaspoons chopped fresh cilantro (optional garnish)</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
        </ul><br>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place your bacon into a Dutch oven (or large skillet)
                and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally until
                evenly browned. About 5 to 10 minutes (or until desired crispiness level).
                Place bacon pieces on a paper towel to drain & collect 1/4 cup of the bacon grease, discard the rest. 
            </li>
            <li>In the same pan, cook the celery and onion in the bacon grease
                until onion is soft and translucent (about 5 minutes). Stir in the 
                garlic and continue cooking for an additional 1 to 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add the potatoes and toss to coat. Saute for about 3 to 4 
                minutes. Place the bacon back into your pan and add the chicken stock. (NOTE - you may
                not need all 4 cups, add enough to cover the potatoes entirely). Place
                a cover and let ingredients simmer until the potatoes are fork tender. (About 15-20 minutes).
            </li>
            <li>In a seperate skillet while that is simmering, melt the butter
                over medium heat. Whisk in the flour stirring constantly for about 1 
                to 2 minutes to create a roux. Whisk in heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro.
            </li>
            <li>Bring this cream mixture to a boil and let cook for about 5 minutes, stirring 
                constantly. Once mixture is thickened add it to the potato mixture & stir to combine.
            </li>
            <li>Transfer only half of the soup to a blender and pur√©e. (You may use an
                immersion blender if you have one on hand, just be sure to not fully
                blend everything, we want our potato soup to have some chunks!) Return
                the blended soup to the dutch oven and add salt & pepper to taste.</li>
