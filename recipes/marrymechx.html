            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>

            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
            <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
            <li>1 cup of heavy cream (whipping cream)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of shredded(or grated) parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chili flakes</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon thyme</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sundried tomatoes (chopped)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh basil leaves (optional - as a garnish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the chicken with salt & pepper, then dredge
                in flour and shake off any excess.
            </li>
            <li>In a large skillet heat olive oil & melt the butter
                on medium heat. Make sure to swirl the pan to coat evenly.
            </li>
            <li>Add chicken to pan (but do not overcrowd). Cook until 
                chicken is browned for about 4-5 minutes on each side. Or
                until chicken is golden brown & cooked through. Remove 
                from pan onto a plate and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In the same skillet, add the garlic and saute for about
                a minute or until fragrant. Add the chicken stock and deglaze 
                the pan using a wooden spoon and pushing any bits stuck to the bottom.
            </li>
            <li>Turn the heat down to medium-low. Add the heavy cream
                and parmesan cheese. Stir until incorporated and let the sauce
                simmer for a couple of minutes. Then add the chili flakes, thyme,
                and oregano. (NOTE: you can adjust the amount of chili flakes 
                added to your desired spice level)
            </li>
            <li>Season with salt & pepper and add in the chopped sundried 
                tomatoes. Put the cooked chicken back into the pan with the sauce.
                Let the sauce simmer for a few more minutes and remove from heat 
                once the sauce reaches your desired thickness.
            </li>
            <li>(Optional) Garnish with chopped fresh basil leaves and 
                serve warm over pasta or rice.
            </li>
        </ol>
